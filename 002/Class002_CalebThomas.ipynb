    "- 21. Why is snake case generally recommended for naming variables?\n",
    "---\n",
    "Snake case is generally recommended for naming variables because it is easy to read and understand. It separates words with underscores, making variable names more readable and descriptive. Snake case is also consistent with the naming conventions used in the Python standard library and is widely accepted in the Python community. By using snake case, programmers can create meaningful and descriptive variable names that are easy to understand and maintain, improving the readability and quality of their code."

    "- 22. What are some common mistakes to avoid when naming variables in Python?\n",
    "---\n",
    "Some common mistakes to avoid when naming variables in Python include using reserved keywords, starting variable names with numbers, using special characters, and using names that are too long or too short. Variable names should be descriptive, meaningful, and follow the naming conventions recommended by Python. They should be concise, clear, and reflect the purpose of the variable in the program. By avoiding common mistakes and following best practices for naming variables, programmers can create code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain, improving the quality and reliability of their programs."

    "- 23. Why can’t you concatenate a string and an integer using the + operator?\n",
    "---\n",
    "You can't concatenate a string and an integer using the + operator because they are different data types. The + operator is used for addition when applied to numbers and concatenation when applied to strings. When you try to concatenate a string and an integer, Python raises a TypeError because it cannot concatenate different data types. To concatenate a string and an integer, you need to convert the integer to a string using the str() function before concatenating them or alternativly using a f-string."

    "You can print a string and an integer together in Python without causing an error by converting the integer to a string using the str() function before printing them. This allows you to concatenate the string and the integer as strings and print them together. Alternatively, you can use f-strings to format the output and include variables directly in the string without converting them to strings. This allows you to print strings and integers together in a single statement without causing an error and provides more flexibility in formatting the output.\n",
