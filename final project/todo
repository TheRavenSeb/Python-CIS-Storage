# TODO List for Final Project

# [x] 1. Build Classes
#     - [x] Create a `Car` class to represent individual cars.
#    - [x] Create a `Garage` class to manage the parking structure.
#   

# 2. Build Functions to Move Cars
#    - [x] Implement functionality to park a car in a specific spot.
#    - [x] Implement functionality to remove a car from a spot.
#    - [x] Implement functionality to move a car from one spot to another.

# 3. Functions for Checking Car Locations
#    - [x] Implement a function to check where a specific car is parked.
#   [x] -  Implement a function to list all empty parking spots.
#    - [x] Implement a function to list all occupied parking spots.
#    - [x] Implement a function to list all cars in the garage.
#    - [x] Implement a function to check the total fullness of the garage.


# 4. make sure to add docstrings to all classes and functions
# 5. Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., trying to park in a full garage, etc.)
# 6. Add unit tests for all classes and functions to ensure they work as expected.
# 7.[x] make a logger programmatically to log all the actions taken in the parking garage (e.g., parking a car, removing a car, etc.)
# 8. Add a user interface (UI) to interact with the parking garage system.
# 9. Class Concepts and Features
- **Car Class** : Implements the concept of a single car.
- **ParkingGarage Class**: Utilizes a combination of `class` and `list`/`set` to manage parked cars.
- **Arrival/Departure**: Simulates car arrival and departure using `random` for unpredictability.
- **Log File**: Uses `File I/O` to log all actions (e.g., parking, removing, moving cars).
- **Unique License Plate**: Employs `set()` for fast lookup and to ensure license plate uniqueness.
