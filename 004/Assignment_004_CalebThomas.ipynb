    "\n",
    "This assignment was a valuable exercise in object-oriented programming and program design. Initially, I faced some challenges in structuring the `DogBreed` class and ensuring that it adhered to the principles of encapsulation and data validation. I overcame these hurdles by carefully planning the class attributes and methods, and by implementing appropriate error handling to prevent invalid data from being entered into the system I also learns how to use and manipulate Python DocStrings for adding documentation to my module.\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect that worked particularly well was the modular design of the code. By separating the `DogBreed` class into its own module, I was able to create a reusable component that could be easily integrated into other programs. Additionally, the use of functions such as `addDogBreed`, `displayAllDogBreeds`, and `searchDogBreed` made the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I encountered some difficulties in implementing the search functionality. Initially, the search function only returned exact matches for the breed name. To improve the search functionality, I researched string matching algorithms and implemented a case-insensitive search that could also identify partial matches. This enhancement made the search function more user-friendly and effective. I consulted the Python documentation on string methods and explored various online resources, such as Stack Overflow, to find suitable solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge I faced was ensuring that the program was robust and handled user input correctly. To address this, I implemented input validation and error handling throughout the code. For example, I added checks to ensure that the life span of a dog was within a reasonable range and that the temperament was one of the allowed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this assignment provided me with valuable experience in designing and implementing object-oriented programs. By carefully planning the code, implementing appropriate error handling, and researching solutions to specific challenges, I was able to create a program that met the requirements of the assignment and provided a useful tool for managing dog breed information.\n"

    "### Question 1: What is the significance of indentation in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation in Python is crucial because it defines the structure and scope of code blocks. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces or keywords to delimit blocks, Python uses indentation. Consistent indentation is essential for the interpreter to understand the code's logic and execute it correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: How does Python handle comments in code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python handles comments using the `#` symbol for single-line comments. Any text following `#` on a line is ignored by the interpreter. Multi-line comments can be created using triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) to enclose the comment block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: What are the primary ways to execute a Python script?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary ways to execute a Python script are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Running it from the command line using `python script_name.py`.\n",
    "2.  Executing it in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VSCode or PyCharm.\n",
    "3.  Running it in an interactive environment like Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: How can you check the version of Python installed on your system?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in the command line. Alternatively, you can use the `sys` module in a Python script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print(sys.version)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: What is the purpose of the Python Interactive Shell?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Interactive Shell (also known as the REPL - Read-Eval-Print Loop) is used for testing snippets of code, debugging, and exploring Python's capabilities in real-time. It allows you to execute Python code line by line and immediately see the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6: What are the fundamental data types in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental data types in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Integers (`int`)\n",
    "*   Floating-point numbers (`float`)\n",
    "*   Strings (`str`)\n",
    "*   Booleans (`bool`)\n",
    "*   Lists (`list`)\n",
    "*   Tuples (`tuple`)\n",
    "*   Dictionaries (`dict`)\n",
    "*   Sets (`set`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7: How do you declare a variable in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you declare a variable by simply assigning a value to it using the assignment operator `=`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "name = \"Caleb\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 8: What is the difference between mutable and immutable data types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable data types can be changed after they are created (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets). Immutable data types cannot be changed after they are created (e.g., integers, floats, strings, tuples). If you try to modify an immutable object, a new object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 9: How does Python handle dynamic typing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses dynamic typing, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime. You don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable; Python infers it based on the assigned value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 10: What function can you use to check the type of a variable in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `type()` function to check the type of a variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 11: What are the different types of operators available in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The different types of operators in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)\n",
    "*   Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)\n",
    "*   Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)\n",
    "*   Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, `**=`)\n",
    "*   Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`)\n",
    "*   Identity operators (`is`, `is not`)\n",
    "*   Membership operators (`in`, `not in`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 12: How does Python handle division differently when using `/` vs `//`?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `/` performs floating-point division, which always returns a float, even if the operands are integers.\n",
    "*   `//` performs floor division, which returns the largest whole number that is less than or equal to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(5 / 2)   # Output: 2.5\n",
    "print(5 // 2)  # Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 13: What is the purpose of the `in` operator in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `in` operator is used to check if a value exists within a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string). It returns `True` if the value is found, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(2 in my_list)  # Output: True\n",
    "print(4 in my_list)  # Output: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 14: What is the difference between `is` and `==` in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `==` checks if the values of two objects are equal.\n",
    "*   `is` checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(a == b)  # Output: True (values are equal)\n",
    "print(a is b)  # Output: False (different objects in memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "c = a\n",
    "print(a is c)  # Output: True (same object in memory)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 15: How does Python handle operator precedence?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python follows a specific order of operations (operator precedence) to determine the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. The order is similar to mathematical conventions (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Parentheses\n",
    "2.  Exponentiation\n",
    "3.  Multiplication and Division\n",
    "4.  Addition and Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 16: What are the different types of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The different types of conditional statements in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `if`\n",
    "*   `if-else`\n",
    "*   `if-elif-else`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 17: How do `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements work in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `if`: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.\n",
    "*   `elif`: (else if) Checks an additional condition if the previous `if` or `elif` condition is false.\n",
    "*   `else`: Executes a block of code if all preceding `if` and `elif` conditions are false.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"Positive\")\n",
    "elif x < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"Negative\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 18: What is the difference between `while` and `for` loops in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `while` loop: Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "*   `for` loop: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string) or other iterable object, executing a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 19: How can you exit a loop prematurely in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can exit a loop prematurely using the `break` statement. When `break` is encountered, the loop terminates immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 20: What does the `continue` statement do in a loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 21: How do you define a function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "You define a function in Python using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`. The function body is indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 22: What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `return` statement is used to exit a function and return a value to the caller. If a function doesn't have a `return` statement, it returns `None` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 23: How can you import a module in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import a module in Python using the `import` statement, followed by the module name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 24: What is the difference between importing a module with `import` vs `from module import`?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `import module`: Imports the entire module. You need to use the module name to access its contents (e.g., `module.function()`).\n",
    "*   `from module import`: Imports specific attributes or functions from the module directly into the current namespace. You can use them without the module name (e.g., `function()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(25))\n",
    "\n",
    "from math import sqrt\n",
    "print(sqrt(25))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 25: How can you check which modules are currently imported in a Python script?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check which modules are currently imported by looking at the top of the program where most will be. Alteranatively you can use the Crtl + F hotkey to search for `import` or programicly by using the `sys.modules` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print(sys.modules.keys())\n",
    "```"
